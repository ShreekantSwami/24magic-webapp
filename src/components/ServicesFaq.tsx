    question: "How do you keep my business information secure?",
    answer:
      "We take security seriously. All connections to your bank statements are read-only, meaning we can never move or access your funds. We store your digital documents in secure, password-protected cloud folders, and we never sell or share your business data.",
  },
  {
    id: "faq-2",
    question: "How long does it take to get started?",
    answer:
      "For standard ongoing bookkeeping, we can have you set up and running in 5 to 7 business days. If your books are behind by months or years, our cleanup team will jump in to organize and catch up your records, which typically takes 2 to 4 weeks depending on the backlog size.",
  },
  {
    id: "faq-3",
    question: "Do you work with QuickBooks?",
    answer:
      "Yes! We work natively with QuickBooks Online and other standard small business tools. We do not replace your accounts—we just keep them clean, categorized, and up-to-date.",
  },
  {
    id: "faq-4",
    question: "Will I have a real person to talk to?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. You will be paired with a dedicated bookkeeping and admin helper who knows your business by name. No automated ticketing systems or robotic support—just real, helpful people.",
